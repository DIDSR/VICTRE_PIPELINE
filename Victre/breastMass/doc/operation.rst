Overview
========

This software defines a breast mass in terms of a three dimensional binary mask where 1 represents a voxel inside the mass and 0 represents a voxel outside the mass.  Masses are randomly generated, with the main body of the mass defined via a Gaussian random sphere technique.  Random branching spicules are grown out from the mass surface.  See the paper by de Sisternes, et al. (`doi.org/10.1118/1.4905232 <https://doi.org/10.1118/1.4905232>`_) for more details on theory of the mass model.

.. note::
   This software was independently developed and may not exactly represent the models represented in the work cited above due to differences in implementation.
